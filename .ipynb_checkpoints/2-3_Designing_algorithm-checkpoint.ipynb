    "Although merge sort runs in $\\theta(n \\lg n)$ worst-case time and insertion sort runs in $\\theta(n^2)$ worst-case time, the constant factors in insertion sort can make it faster in practice for small problem sizes on many machines. Thus it makes sense to **coarsen** the leaves of the recursion by using insertion sort whithin merge sort when subproblems become sufficiently small. Consider a modification to merge sort in which $n/k$ sublists of length $k$ are sorted using insertion sort and then merged using the standard merging mechanism, where $k$ is a value to be determined.
